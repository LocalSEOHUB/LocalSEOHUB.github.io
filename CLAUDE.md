# Working in this repository

A solo-author static blog: Astro 7 + TypeScript, deployed to GitHub Pages under the
served from the domain root. Full detail in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Development

Start the dev server in background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage it with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, `astro dev logs`.

```bash
npm run dev      # localhost:4321/blog/ — drafts visible
npm run build    # production build + Pagefind index
npm run preview  # serves dist/ — the only faithful test of search and base paths
npm run check    # TypeScript + Astro diagnostics; keep this at 0 errors
```

**On this Windows machine**, Smart App Control blocks Astro's native compiler binary.
After every `npm install` or `npm ci`:

```bash
npm install --no-save --force @astrojs/compiler-binding-wasm32-wasi
```

## Rules that are easy to get wrong

**Never write a root-absolute internal path.** It happens to work today — this is a
user site with `base: '/'` — but that is hosting, not design. Use the helpers in
`src/lib/url.ts` so the site can move again without a rewrite:

| Helper | For |
| --- | --- |
| `withBase(p)` | paths you author — `/about/` → `/about/` here, `/blog/about/` under a base |
| `absFromBuiltPath(p, site)` | paths Astro produced (`Astro.url.pathname`, `ImageMetadata.src`, `paginate()` URLs) — **already based** |
| `absUrl(p, site)` | absolute URL from a path you author |

Do not try to collapse these into one function that detects whether a path "already has
the base". That was tried and shipped two bugs: `/blog/my-post/` is genuinely ambiguous
because a `/blog/` route sits under a `/blog/` base.

**`paginate()` URLs already include the base.** Passing them through `withBase()`
doubles it the moment a base is configured. `Pagination.astro` takes them raw.

**Query posts through `getPosts()`** in `src/lib/posts.ts`, never `getCollection`
directly. That single call is where drafts are filtered out of production builds and
where date ordering happens.

**Frontmatter image paths are relative to the Markdown file** —
`../../assets/images/uploads/…` — because `image()` resolves them that way and the CMS
is configured to write exactly that. Both `media_folder` and `public_folder` in
`public/admin/config.yml` must stay in sync with wherever posts live.

**Site-wide settings live in `src/consts.ts` and nowhere else.** If you find yourself
hardcoding a title, an author name or a page size, put it there instead.

**The CMS schema and the Zod schema must match.** `public/admin/config.yml` field names
and `src/content.config.ts` are one contract; changing either alone breaks editing or
breaks the build.

**`public/admin/config.yml` is YAML.** Quote any string containing `: ` — an unquoted
colon-space silently breaks the whole CMS.

## Before calling a change done

```bash
npm run check    # expect 0 errors
npm run build
grep -rhoE 'https?://[^"< ]+' dist --include=*.html | grep -v 'localseohub.github.io' | sort -u
```

The grep must print only genuinely external URLs (giscus, google maps, unpkg). If the change is visible in a browser, verify with
`npm run preview` rather than `npm run dev` — search, `/admin/` and draft exclusion all
behave differently between the two.

## Deployment

Push to `main` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys. Saving in the CMS is
a push. See [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md).

Pages source is set to **GitHub Actions** (`build_type: workflow`). Do not switch it
back to *Deploy from a branch* — that starts a parallel Jekyll build which fails on
every push because Jekyll cannot parse `.astro` files. And never "fix" that with a
`.nojekyll` file: under branch mode it publishes the raw repository root instead of the
built site.

Local git authenticates as `LocalSEOHUB`; the repository is owned by `LocalSEOHUB`.
